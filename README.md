Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This Job listings page is yet another [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge and it was fun working with React again.

It's also my first time trying out the popular Tailwind CSS framework and it was nice working with it. I guess the reason is because I've used Tachyons on a couple of projects before and they're both functional CSS libraries.

- Built with React JS and Tailwind CSS Framework.
