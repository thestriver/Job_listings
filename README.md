Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This Job listings page is yet another [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and it was fun working with React again.

It's also my first time trying out the popular Tailwind CSS framework and it was nice working with it. I guess it's mainly cause I'm used to using Tachyons and they're both functional CSS libraries.
